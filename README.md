# Graphical function library

This library aims to provide a simple way to render mathematical functions, offering a simple graphical library and function interpreter.
All instructions are in main.cpp file! <3

## Output Images
First image, can be produce by running main

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

GNU GCC Compiler OR Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler

### Cloning, compiling and running

Instructions to compile on GNU GCC Compiler

```
git clone https://github.com/ArthoPacini/functionDraw
cd functionDraw/
make
./main
```

## Goals

- [X] Draw lines, spheres, rectangles, triangles, multi-lines and polygons of different colors
- [X] Draw function from external file
- [X] Output .ppm and .bmp files
- [X] Interpret a mathematical expression and produce a result, utilizing constans, variables and operators + - * / ^
- [ ] Improve expression interpreter to accept square root, sine, cosine and tangent functions
